Work for Project 2 in UC Berkeley ATDP Web Development

Link to Website: https://atdpsites.berkeley.edu/rwan/Project2/homepage.php 

## Overview
This project is a mockup of a boba tea store's webpage and includes the ability for the user to create their own account, log in with a unique password, and browse through the menu to order whatever drinks or food they desire. Admin accounts and passwords also exist already, and logging in through one will allow the user to edit, add, or delete items from the menu. 

## Prompt
Create a multi-page dynamic website that integrates HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. The site must support user account creation, authentication, and session management, with distinct access levels for administrators and standard users.

Standard users should be able to register, log in, and interact with the site (e.g., posting content, managing their profile, or making purchases, depending on your chosen theme).

Administrators should have elevated privileges, such as editing or deleting user content, managing site data, or performing actions unavailable to standard users.

The project must demonstrate proper database integration (SQL) for storing user credentials and content.

JavaScript is optional but may be included for enhanced interactivity.

Example site models include: discussion forums (e.g., Reddit), e-commerce platforms, or other applications where authenticated users and admins have different capabilities.
